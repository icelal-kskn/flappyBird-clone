# flappyBird-clone
This is a Java program that implements the game Flappy Bird. 
The program uses the java.awt and javax.swing libraries to create the game window and handle user input.
It creates a JFrame, Timer, and Renderer objects, and uses an ArrayList to store the walls that the bird must navigate through. The program also uses the ActionListener, MouseListener, and KeyListener interfaces to handle user interactions. 
The game logic is implemented in the actionPerformed method, which updates the game state and redraws the game components on the screen. 
The program also has methods for adding new walls, painting the walls, and resetting the game when it is over.
